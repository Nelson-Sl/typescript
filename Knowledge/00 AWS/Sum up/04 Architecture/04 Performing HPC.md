# Service that serves HPC
---

## Data Management & Transfer
---

* **AWS Direct Connect**
	* Move GB/s of data to the cloud, over a private secure network
* **Snowball & Snowmobile** 
	* Move PB of data to the cloud
* **AWS DataSync** 
	* Move large amount of data between on-premises and S3, EFS, FSx for Windows

## Computing
---

* EC2 Instances
	* **CPU optimized**, **GPU optimized** 
	* **Spot Instances / Spot Fleets** for cost savings + **Auto Scaling**
* EC2 Placement Groups
	* Cluster **for good network performance**

## Networking
---

* EC2 Enhanced Networking (SR-IOV)
	* **Higher bandwidth**, **higher PPS (packet per second)**, **lower latency**
	* Option 1: **Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)** up to 100 Gbps
	* Option 2: **Intel 82599 VF up to 10 Gbps** â€“ LEGACY
* Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)
	* Improved ENA for **HPC**, only works for Linux
	* Great for **inter-node communications**, tightly coupled workloads
	* Leverages **Message Passing Interface (MPI)** standard
	* Bypasses the underlying Linux OS to provide low-latency, reliable transport

## Storage
---

* Instance-attached storage
	* **EBS**: scale up to 256,000 IOPS with io2 Block Express
	* **Instance Store**: scale to millions of IOPS, linked to EC2 instance, low latency
* Network Storage
	* **Amazon S3**: large blob, not a file system
	*
