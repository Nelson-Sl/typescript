# RDBMS (= SQL / OLTP)
---

* RDS, Aurora
	* Store **relational datasets (RDBMS / OLTP)**, perform **SQL queries, transactions**
		* Great for JOIN Queries
	* Aurora **Cost 20% higher**, but with **less maintenance / more flexibility / more performance / more features**


# NoSQL Database
---

## ElasticCache: Key/Value Pair
---

* **Frequent Read But Less Writes**
	* cache **results for DB queries**
	* **store session data** for websites
* Can't use SQL & Need Application Change

## DynamoDB
---

* Distributed serverless cache
	* Can replace ElastiCache as a key/value store (storing session data for example, using TTL feature), **distributed but slight lower performance**
* Serverless applications development (**small documents** 100s KB)
* Great for application to **rapidly evolve schemas**

## Document DB
---

* AWS version of **MongoDB**, store, query, and index JSON data
	* Fully Managed, **highly available with replication across 3 AZ** (Similar to Aurora)
	* automatically **grows in increments of 10GB, up to 64 TB**
	* Automatically **scales to workloads with millions of requests per seconds**

# Object Store: S3 / Glacier
---

* S3
	* store **static files**
	* key value store for **big files**
	* **Media / Website hosting**
	* **Archive Files**
* Glacier
	* **Archive Files**

# Graph Database: AWS Neptune
---

* Fully managed **graph** database, displays **relationships between data**
	* **Highly available across 3 AZ, with up to 15 read replicas, across AZs** (Similar to Aurora)
	* Can **store up to billions of relations and query** the graph with milliseconds latency
* Use Cases
	* Good for build and run applications **working with highly connected datasets** – optimized for these complex and hard queries
		* E.g. **knowledge graphs (Wikipedia)**, **fraud detection**, **recommendation** **engines**, **social networking**
