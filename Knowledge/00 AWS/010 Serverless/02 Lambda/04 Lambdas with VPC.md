# How do lambdas work with VPC?
---

* By default, your Lambda function is launched **outside your own VPC** (in an AWS -owned VPC), therefore **cannot access resources in your VPC** (RDS, ElastiCache, internal ELBâ€¦)
* To access VPC in lambda, you must **define the VPC ID, the Subnets and the Security Groups**, then Lambda **will create an ENI (Elastic Network Interface) in your subnets**
