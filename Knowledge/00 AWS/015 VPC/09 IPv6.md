# What's IPv6?
---

* IPv6 is the successor of **IPv4** & is designed to provide **3.4 × 10^38** unique IP addresses
	* Every address is **public** and **Internet-routable** (**no private range**)
	* Format
		* x.x.x.x.x.x.x.x (x is **hexadecimal**, range can be from **0000 to ffff**)
		* E.g.
			* 2001:db8:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888
			* **::** -> all 8 segments are zero
			* **2001:db8::** -> the last 6 segments are zero

# Usage in VPC
---

* You can enable IPv6 (they’re public IP addresses) to operate in dual-stack mode
