# What's Traffic Monitoring?
---

* Allows you to **capture and inspect network traffic in your VPC** & Route the traffic to **security appliances** that you manage (**ENI** -> **ENI** or **Network Load Balancer**)
	* Source and Target can be **in the same VPC** or **different VPCs (VPC Peering)**
	* Can **capture and truncate packets wanted**
