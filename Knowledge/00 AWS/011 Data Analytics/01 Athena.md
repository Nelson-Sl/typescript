# Performance Improvement
---

* Use **columnar data** for cost-savings (less scan, huge performance improvement)
	* E.g. **Apache Parquet** or **ORC** (Use [[06 Glue|Glue]] to convert to it)
* **Compress data** for smaller retrievals (bzip2, gzip, lz4, snappy, zlip, zstdâ€¦)
* **Partition datasets in S3** for easy querying on virtual columns
	* E.g. s3://athena-examples/flight/parquet/year=1991/month=1/day=1/
* **Use larger files** (> 128 MB) to minimize overhead
# Use Cases
---

* **Business intelligence / analytics / reporting**
* Analyze & query **VPC Flow Logs, ELB Logs, CloudTrail trails**, etc... (from S3)
