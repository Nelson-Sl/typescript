* **Per-region** service that
	* Helps with **auditing and recording compliance** of your AWS resources

		* Do my buckets have any public access?

## Config Rules (For Compliance)
---

* **AWS managed config rules** (over 75)
* **Custom config rules** (must be defined in AWS Lambda)
	* Can be evaluated / triggered **for each config change** or **at regular time intervals** but does not prevent actions from happening (no deny)
	* E.g. Evaluate if **each EBS disk is of type gp2**

### Remidiations

* **Automate remediation of non-compliant resources** using **SSM Automation Documents**
	* Use **AWS-Managed Automation Documents** or create **custom Automation Documents**
	* Can set **Remediation Retries** if the resource is still non-compliant after auto-remediation
