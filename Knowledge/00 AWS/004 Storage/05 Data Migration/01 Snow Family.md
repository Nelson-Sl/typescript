# What's Snow Family
---

* **Highly-secure, portable devices** to **collect and process data at the
edge**, and **migrate data into and out of AWS**. It includes **SnowCone**, **Snowball Edge** and **Snowmobile**

* Note: Snowball cannot import to Glacier directly, you must use Amazon S3 first, **in combination with an S3 lifecycle policy**

## SnowCone
---
* Small, portable computing device used for **edge computing**, **storage**, and **data transfer**. 
	* **8TB** HDD or **14TB** SSD Storage
	* **2 CPUs**, **4 GB** of memory, wired or wireless access
	* **USB-C power** using a cord or the optional battery
	* Support for [[05 DataSync|AWS DataSync]] to send data
* Good for **space-constrainted** environment
## SnowBall Edge
---

* Provide **block storage** and **Amazon S3-compatible object storage** with Edge computing abilities (on **EC2 Instance** & **AWS Lambda**)
	* Storage Optimized: Up to **40 vCPUs**, **80 GiB of RAM**, **80 TB storage** & Object storage clustering
	* Compute Optimized: 
		* 104 vCPUs, 416 GiB of RAM
		* **Optional GPU** (useful for video processing or machine learning)
		* **42 TB** of HDD or **28 TB** NVMe capacity

## SnowMobile
---

* Each Snowmobile has **100 PB of capacity** (use multiple in parallel) & **Transfer exabytes of data** (1 EB = 1,000 PB = 1,000,000 TBs)
	* **High security**: temperature controlled, GPS, 24/7 video surveillance
* Good for **extreme large data migration**

# How to use Snow Family
---

1. Request Snowball devices from the AWS console for delivery
2. Install the snowball client / AWS OpsHub (GUI Interface for Snowball) on your servers
3. Connect the snowball to your servers and copy files using the client
4. Ship back the device when youâ€™re done (goes to the right AWS
facility)
5. Data will be loaded into an S3 bucket
6. Snowball is completely wiped

# Why use Snow Family
---

* Provide faster & stabler solution of **data migrating & processing** in edge location (Limited network/bandwidth/computing resource)
	* E.g. Preprocess data, Machine learning at the edge, Transcoding media streams, large data cloud migrations, DC decommission, disaster recovery
